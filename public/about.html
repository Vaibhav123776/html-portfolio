<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Vaibhav Kumar. Right now, I’m studying for my B-tech degree .
It’s an exciting time for me as I dive deeper into the world of technology and engineering.</p>

<p>In college, I get to learn about various subjects related to my field.
We share ideas and help each other out, which makes learning more fun and engaging.</p>

<p>Outside of classes, I like to explore new things, whether it’s joining clubs or participating in events.
I believe these experiences are just as important as academics, helping me grow and meet new people along the way.</p>
